the author studied the growth of the amplitude in a mathieu-like equationwith multiplicative white noise. the approximate value of the exponent at theextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically byintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculatednumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplecticnumerical method. the mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $lpha$ thatis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the couplingbetween the variable and the noise. the value of $lpha$ was restricted not tobe negative without loss of generality. it was shown that the exponentdecreases with $lpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. it wasalso found that the exponent as a function of $lpha$ has only one minimum at$lpha 
eq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $lpha = 0$. this minimumvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically. the existence of the minimumat $lpha 
eq 0$ indicates the suppression of the growth by multiplicativewhite noise.
we prove that the average smooth renyi entropy rate will approach the entropyrate of a stationary, ergodic information source, which is equal to the shannonentropy rate for a classical information source and the von neumann entropyrate for a quantum information source.
dick dalitz produced lasting contributions to particle physics for 50 years.along with dalitz pairs, dalitz plots and cdd poles, he did major work inparity violation, hyperon resonance identification, the quark model, andhypernuclei. these topics will be summarized, with some emphasis on theauthor's collaboration with dalitz on quark spin and fragmentationcorrelations, and, particularly, the work on the identification of the topquark and its mass. short biographical information is interspersed. this paperis based on a presentation at the international school of subnuclear physics,erice 2006.
